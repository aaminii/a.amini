abstract: In this report we present the results from the diagnostics of plasma density to characterize plasma sources aimed towards usage in Plasma Wake Field Acceleration at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (INFN). The strategy we followed to measure the density values relies on the phenomenon of Stark broadening effect. Using Time-Resolved Spectroscopy, we have acquired data from two different cylindrical capillaries and analysed it computationally as function of different controllable parameters. For the 3cm×2mm capillary we found the density values of the order of 10 17 cm −3 while for the 3cm×1mm we found the density values of the order of 10 18 cm −3. We provide a detailed explanation of the construction of the optical system required to perform the task.
