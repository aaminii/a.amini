abstract: A complete thermodynamic analysis of a novel combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system based on molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) as the prime mover, single-effect water-lithium bromide absorption chiller, polymer fuel cell (PEMFC), as well as heat and hydrogen storage tanks, has been performed. Risk and reliability analyses were performed, which are two of the most significant achievements that have not been previously examined in similar studies. A thermodynamic analysis was performed on three scenarios, and one of them revealed an energy efficiency of 87.85% and exergy efficiency of 86.62% for the hybrid CCHP system. Also, the results indicated that increasing the fuel consumption factor decreases the M-factor (ratio of production power to the total power and heat production in the fuel cell) and output hydrogen from the MCFC. The results of system reliability and risk analyses indicate that the mean times to the first failure of the MCFC, PEMFC, and absorption chiller are 19459.57, 1404.04, and 86104.07 working hours under normal conditions, respectively. In one of the scenarios, the calculated amount of economic efficiency and payback period of investment by calculating the inflation rate are 6.3% and 3.1 years, respectively.
